# Run

A keyboard-based terminal calculator made in Rust, and it should have features that an ordinary calculator has.

## Features

- **Math**: It should have all of the normal operators, such as: *, +, -, ^, /, and %.
- **Variabes**: Predefined variables are: e (Eulers number), phi (Golden ratio), and pi (Pi). There are also custom variables that you can define. For example:
```bash
> x=10
=> 1.0 # Uses 1.0 as success and 0.0 as fail.
> x^2
=> 100.0 # x^2 = 10^2
```
- **Functions**: There are quite many functions that are built in some of them are: sin, cos, tan, sqrt, root, log and ln. (Custom functions are coming someday)
